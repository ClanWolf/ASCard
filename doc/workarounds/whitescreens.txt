Problem:
On Chrome (or chromium based browsers), sometimes a screen turns completly white and irresponsive.

Solutions:
- Use other browser (like "Fullscreen Browser" on Android)
- Set this to avoid issue:
	1. launch the browser
	2. navigate in browser to "chrome://flags/"
	3. Disable "Enables Display Compositor to use a new gpu thread"
