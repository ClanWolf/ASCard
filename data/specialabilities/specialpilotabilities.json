Each attack is resolved using the modifiers appropriate to the target’s movement, range, and other conditions; the divided attack will not impose any further Target Number modifiers. Each successful attack divided in this way will halve the damage (rounded down, to a minimum of 1) that the unit would ordinarily inflict against a single target at the appropriate range bracket.<br>For example, a Multi-Tasker unit with a damage value of 4/3/2 may decide to target two separate enemies—one at Short range, and the other at Medium. If both attacks succeed, the target at Short range will receive 2 points of damage (4 ÷ 2 = 2), while the Mediumrange target will receive only 1 point of damage (3 ÷ 2 = 1.5, round down to 1)",
